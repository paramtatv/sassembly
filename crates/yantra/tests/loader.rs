//! `F-001e2a` — the loader: ADR-0015 clause A1 executed rather than described.
//!
//! # What these tests are for
//!
//! `F-001e1` wrote the entry contract down and asserted the tables against the registries
//! they are made of. Nothing entered anything. This file enters something: an ELF the
//! project's own writer produced, placed by [`yantra::loader::load_application`], reached
//! by a real `sret`, running in user mode at its own `e_entry` on a stack it did not
//! choose.
//!
//! # The three claims, and how each is falsifiable
//!
//! 1. **The register file is `spec/application-entry.tsv`'s, all 32 of it.**
//!    [`every_register_at_entry_is_the_one_the_contract_names`] reads that table and
//!    checks each row against the machine — so a loader that left a leftover in `s3`
//!    fails, and so does one that stops setting a register the table names.
//! 2. **The machine changes mode, not the loader.** The loader leaves `sepc`, `SPP` and
//!    `satp` set and stops. One `sret` — one instruction the interpreter executes —
//!    is what puts the hart in U-mode, and
//!    [`the_sret_is_what_enters_user_mode_and_the_loader_only_sets_it_up`] reads the
//!    privilege back out on both sides of that single step.
//! 3. **The program does not learn its load address.** Its frames are the loader's, they
//!    are nowhere in its registers, and its own virtual addresses are nothing like them.
//!
//! # The fixture is not an application
//!
//! `F-001e3` writes the smallest honest application, and ADR-0015 forbids writing one
//! early to make `F-001` satisfiable. The programs here are three and four instructions of
//! hand-encoded RV64 in a `kosha` ELF — enough to prove the loader entered *something*,
//! deliberately not enough to be mistaken for an app, and not in `spec/`.
